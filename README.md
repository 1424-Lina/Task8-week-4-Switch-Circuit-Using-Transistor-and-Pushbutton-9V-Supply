# Task8-week-4-Switch-Circuit-Using-Transistor-and-Pushbutton-9V-Supply
This project demonstrates how to build a simple latching power switch circuit using an NPN transistor and a pushbutton, powered by a 9V battery. When the pushbutton is pressed, the transistor activates and allows current to flow, turning on the load (such as an LED or relay), simulating an automatic power-on behavior.

ðŸ”§ Components Used:
	â€¢	NPN Transistor (e.g., BC547 or 2N2222)
	â€¢	9V Battery
	â€¢	2 Ã— Resistors
	â€¢	1 Ã— Pushbutton
	â€¢	Jumper Wires
	â€¢	Breadboard
